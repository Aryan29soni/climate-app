hello everyone, this is the repostitory for a live location weather app i've built. it has functionalities such as asking user permission for their live location, callbacks to the getLocation() method, and getting the current weather for any place on earth, using the openweathermap API.


I've also spent time in  defining various functions to keep the code clean and maintainable.
